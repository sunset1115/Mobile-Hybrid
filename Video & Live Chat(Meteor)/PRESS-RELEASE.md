There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Jabber is an innovative application for foreign language learners that emphasizes the two most important steps in learning a language - speaking and listening. 

## Sub-Heading ##
  Our audio-centric platform will help anyone in the world learn any language remotely.

## Summary ##
  After creating an account, you'll be connected with language learners for whom you are a match. You'll use our native video-chat to conduct language exchange with partners, and be able to record the audio of the chat so that you can later listen both to yourself and the native speaker you were chatting with. You'll be able to splice any part of that chat into smaller audio segments and manipulate and tag these segments in a number of ways to help you practice and retain what you said and heard during every language exchange. 

## Problem ##
  When you are learning a language remotely, the most difficult part is finding opportunities to practice your speech and hear actual speech from native speakers. On the other hand, when you're learning a language in the target language's society, you might wish you had a recorder as you chatted during the day, so that you could listen at the end of the day to your conversations and retain more of what you said and heard. 

## Solution ##
  We solve these two problems by leveraging the power of the internet in two important ways. We use the peer-to-peer capability of the internet to match language learners and provide a seamless environment for conversation practice. And we use internet data storage to give users the ability to record and manipulate the audio of their conversations to help them retain every sound spoken. Modern browser technologies and the asychronous capabilities of Node.js help use achieve both these solutions. 

## Quote from You ##
  "Be like a baby - surrender yourself to a world of sound and you can learn any language" 

## How to Get Started ##
  Simply create an account, link up with a recommended language partner, and use our intuitive to UI to record your conversations and manipulate audio snippets of that conversation. 

## Customer Quote ##
  "I never thought it was possible to learn a language in this way through the internet! Thanks to Jabber, I'm so much closer to my goal of becoming fluent in Tagalog!" - Bill Killmer

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  What are you waiting for? Create an account with Jabber and accelerate your language learning in a way you never thought possible.
