Hello everyone!
You can see my sample app.

book-store is very useful hybrid app.
This is a user's little libray.

And WheatherApp is my first Hybrid app.
This is based on Ionic.

And Ekiosk_H is Hybrid app of ekioskmobile.net site.
This is developed by using Node.js and Google Polymer.
This is runned grunt-server.

Boat is boat rental for HongKong.
The owner of boat managed his boat.
This app is connected to server by using the REST api.

Thank you. Best regards.
